Chapter 1

The Blackhearts Detective Agency. There's no place like home. I feel a pang of hunger in my stomach. I'd fill my fridge if I could. Problem is, a detective's pay is not exactly luxurious. I need a job. And I need it fast. I'm throwing darts at the lord barrister's picture when the phone rings. It's Nellie. She is in a hurry. I furrow my brow. It doesn't seem good. She will owe me after this. I get ready to leave for the power plant.
